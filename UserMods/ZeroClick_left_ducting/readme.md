# ZeroClick on left ducting
<p align="center"><img width="300" src="assets/ZeroClick_left_duct.png"></p>

## Idea about this mod
This mod is started for the HexZero. <br>
The HexZero has the dual extrusions in the back, like the Voron V0.2. <br>
On the HexZero the change is made, that the gantry can move over these dual extrusions. <br>
There is that little space, that there can't be parts on the back of the toolhead, because these would collide with these Z-extrusions. <br>
This mod moves the probe to the side, to give free space on the back, to prevent this collision. <br>

## Which 3d parts are shared
Only the modded parts can be find in this mod. <br>
Non modded parts, that are the default AntHead parts and can be find in de main repository of the AntHead. <br>
Only the standard fan is modded. Other fan ductings are not changed, but could be done by de delivered CAD.

## Hardware needed for this mode
### For the AntHead
Nothing extra is needed for the AntHead, when looking at the hardware. <br>
### For the ZeroClick
The default parts for the ZeroClick are needed. <br>
Extra parts could be the parts for the dock, depends on the user choice, what to use. <br>
For the ZeroClick follow there github. <br>

## How to wire the ducting
Before following the ZeroClick manual, the explanation how the wiring has to be done
### Step 1
Start by placing wire in the wire-guide of the front magnet-hole and let it stick out of the back. <br>

### Step 2
Loop back the wire and place it back in the hole it comes out, but now in the wire-guide that goes underneat the fan. <br> 
Carefully pull on the wire end and help them, that the loop disappears inside the ducting, and nothing is sticking out the back. <br>
Not easy to draw in Rhino, to make a wire loop, but you will get it what i mean :blush: <br>

### Step 3
Place the wire-guide of the back magnet-hole. <br> 
This wire-guide hole is almost in line with the wire-guide underneat the fan, that you can route it in a single job. <br>

### Step 4
Now that the ZeroClick wires are near the fan, follow the wire route of the fan.
